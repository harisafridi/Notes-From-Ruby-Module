Object Oriented Ruby

- Explain OOP
- Write a class containing getters, setter, and instance variables
- Write a class which inherits from another
- Explain public, private and global

What is OOP?
- Object = state  + behaviour
- State is defined by variables
- Behavious is described by methods
- Every object will have its behaviour

- --  - - Object --- 
  -Property --- - Method

-Encapsulation: Means we are going to store the details of state of an 
		object as variables, we can only access them via methods - setter and getter
-Inheritance
-Polymorphism
